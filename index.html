        <h1>How does the autonomous vehicle industry show that their technology is safe?</h1>

        <p class = "name"> By Emily Yip</p>

        <p>
            Autonomous vehicles (AV) are transforming modern transportation. As AV companies expand into various 
            metropolitan cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, concerns regarding 
            passenger safety continue to shape public perception. Understanding how AV companies demonstrate 
            that their vehicles are safe is critical to gaining public trust and successful widespread deployment. 
            This document provides an overview of the methods and data that AV companies employ to communicate the 
            safety of their vehicles.
        </p>

        <p> AV companies adhere to the following standards for the development of their vehicles:</p>

    <div class="metric-grid">

        <div class="metric-item">

            <p><strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Framework for Automated Driving Safety (ADS)</strong> 

                A framework that outlines how AV developers should design, test, and validate their vehicles.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="metric-item">

            <p><strong> ISO 26262</strong> 

                International standard for functional safety in road vehicles

        </div>

        <div class="metric-item">

            <p><strong>ISO 21448 (SOTIF - Safety of the Intended Functionality)</strong>

            but acts in a way that is unsafe or unexpected in specific situations

        <div class="metric-item">

        <h2>Safety Metrics</h2>
    
        <p> AV companies evaluate their vehicles on the following metrics and compare them to human crash benchmarks to highlight that they can actually
            be safer than human driving. The human crash benchmarks are public data published by the NHTSA.</p>

        <p>AV companies post videos of their vehicles navigating complex traffic situations that could have been easily misnavigated by a human being.
        For example, Aurora uploaded footage of their truck navigating aggressive swerves and tire blowouts on their website. Waymo also posts videos on
        their Youtube channel of their vehicle navigating road occlusions and sudden pedestrian appearances.

        <h2 class = "same">Safety Innovations</h2>

        <p> AV companies show the safety of their vehicles by highlighting safety innovation features. For example, Zoox employs a bidirectional 
            vehicle design, a four wheel independent steering, braking system, a seatbelt crash avoidance system, and an independent redundant backup 
            systems as detailed in their safety innovation report. Zoox also includes a Missions Operations Team that monitors the health of the 
            robotaxis real time, ensuring safety during the ride.</p>

        <h2 class = "btd">Beyond the Data</h2>

        <p>One of the most effective methods in building the credibility of autonomous vehicles is community outreach. 
            As someone who has been in an AV before, describing my positive experience to my family and friends usually turns 
            their safety concerns into enthusiasm for the future of autonomous technology. <br><br>
            
            Zoox does community outreach by holding first responder training workshops to help them identify emergency safety functions in the vehicle. 
            Zoox also includes testimonial messages from members of the police and fire departments from its operating cities in its safety report. <br><br>

            Waymo also has its own Community Partners division, where they collaborate with organizations both local to San Francisco and nationwide, 
            such as Lighthouse for the Blind SF and The Epilepsy Foundation to spread awareness on the accessibility and safety of their vehicles for the disabled 
            (Waymo, 2025). To spark interest in AV in the broader population, Waymo also sponsors content creators to document their experience of riding in a Waymo vehicle
            for the first time.
