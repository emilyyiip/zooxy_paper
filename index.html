        <h1>How does the autonomous vehicle industry prove that their technology is safe?</h1>

            Autonomous vehicles (AV) are transforming modern transportation. As AV companies expand into various 
            metropolitan cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, concerns regarding 
            passenger safety continue to shape public perception. Understanding how autonomous car companies demonstrate 
            that their vehicles are safe is critical to gaining public trust and successful widespread deployment. This document provides an 
            overview of the methods and data that AV companies employ to communicate the safety of their vehicles.
