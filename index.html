        <h1>How does the autonomous vehicle industry prove that their technology is safe?</h1>

        <p class = "name"> By Emily Yip</p>

        <p class="writing">
            Autonomous vehicles (AV) are transforming modern transportation. As AV companies expand into various 
            metropolitan cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, concerns regarding 
            passenger safety continue to shape public perception. Understanding how AV companies demonstrate 
            that their vehicles are safe is critical to gaining public trust and successful widespread deployment. 
            This document provides an overview of the methods and data that AV companies employ to communicate the 
            safety of their vehicles.

            <p><strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Framework for Automated Driving Safety (ADS)</strong> 
                A framework that outlines how AV developers should design, test, and validate their vehicles.</p>

        <h2>Safety Metrics</h2>
    
        <p> AV companies evaluate their cars on these metrics and compare them to human crash benchmarks to highlight that autonomy can actually
            be safer than human driving. The human crash benchmarks are public data published by the NHTSA.</p>

        <h2 class = "same">Safety Innovations</h2>

        <p> Companies also show the safety of their vehicles by highlighting safety innovation features. For example, Zoox employs a bidirectional 
            vehicle design, a four wheel independent steering, braking system, a seatbelt crash avoidance system, and an independent redundant backup 
            systems that they detail in their safety innovation report. Zoox also includes a Missions Operations Team that monitors the health of the 
            robotaxis real time, </p>

        <h2 class = "btd">Beyond the Data</h2>

        <p>One of the most effective methods in building the credibility of autonomous vehicles is community outreach. 
            From someone who has been in an AV before, describing my positive experience to my family and friends transforms 
            their safety concerns into excitement for the future of autonomous technology. <br><br>
            
            Zoox does community outreach by holding hands-on first responder training workshops to help them identify emergency safety functions 
            and address concerns (Zoox, 2025a). Zoox also includes testimonial messages from members of the police and fire departments 
            from its operating cities in its safety report. <br><br>

            Waymo also has its own Community Partners division, where they collaborate with organizations both local to San 
            Francisco and nation-wide to spread awareness on the accessibility and safety of their vehicles (Waymo, 2025). 
            Waymo has partnered with local San Francisco nonprofits such as the Lighthouse for the Blind SF and The Epilepsy Foundation 
            to demonstrate that their vehicles as a safe transportation option for disabled communities. To spark interest in AV 
            in the broader population, Waymo also sponsors content creators such as Veritasium to document their experience of riding in a Waymo vehicle.
