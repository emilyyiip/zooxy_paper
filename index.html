            <h1>How does the autonomous vehicle industry show that their technology is safe?</h1>

            <p class="name"> By Emily Yip</p>

            <p>
                Autonomous vehicles (AV) are transforming modern transportation. As AV companies expand into various
                metropolitan cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, concerns regarding
                passenger safety continue to shape public perception. Understanding how AV companies demonstrate
                that their vehicles are safe is critical to gaining public trust and successful widespread deployment.
                This document provides an overview of the methods and data that AV companies employ to communicate the
                safety of their vehicles.
            </p>

            <p> AV companies adhere to the following standards for the development of their vehicles:</p>

                        A framework that outlines how AV developers should design, test, and validate their vehicles.

            <h2>Safety Metric Data</h2>

            <p> AV companies evaluate their vehicles on the following metrics and compare them to human crash benchmarks
                to highlight that they can actually
                be safer than human driving. The human crash benchmarks are <a href="https://cdan.dot.gov/ target="

            <p> Data such as injury causing crashes and vehicle to vehicle collisions tell how often crashes occur and
                their severity, showing that their vehicles reduce the chances of life-threatening events. Delta-V and
                incidents per
                million miles provide operational insight into how their vehicles anticipate hazards and handle complex
                scenarios. These metrics combined indicate whether an autonomous system is actually safer than a human
                driver, how it behaves in risky environments, and where it could improve in performance, building
                transparency and public trust.</p>

        <section id="test-sim">

            <h2 class="testsim">Test and Simulation Data</h2>

            <p>AV Companies rigorously test their vehicles through simulations that recreate high risk edge cases using
                sensors, labelled objects, and highly detailed mapping. </p>

            <div class="sim-panel">

                <div class="panel">

                    <div class="panel-header">

                        <h3> Sensors</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p> AV companies use light and detection ranging data (LiDAR) to measure depth from a vehicle to
                        objects, enabling the creation of a detailed 3D mapping of its surroundings.<br><br>

                        Vehicles also use radars for real-time speed and distance measurements. Radars excel in harsher
                        weather and lighting conditions. <br><br>

                        Long wave and infared cameras are used to detect pedestrians in low light and provide visibility
                        through fog and smoke.

                        <h3> Objects</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p>Extensively labelled object datasets are needed to simulate realistic scenarios. Companies use
                        various 3D and 2D semantic segmentation labels, video camera data, and features

                        per pixel ray information. They include images ranging from pedestrians and bicyclists to road
                        signs and vegetation, ensuring their models are generalizable to all roads. </p>

                </div>

                <div class="panel">

                    <div class="panel-header">

                        <h3> Mapping</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p> Detailed mapping of roads in operating cities is critical to AV performance. AV companies create
                        3D maps of road graph segments, which includes boundaries, road signs, bumps, and entrances to
                        driveways. These maps also store semantic information such as which lanes pedestrians will
                        typically cross in and traffic flows on busier intersections. </p>

                </div>

            </div>

            <p> With this data, companies can conduct large-scale simulations and road testing to show the safety of
                their vehicles. To make these results more transparent, they also share footage of their vehicles
                navigating challenging traffic scenarios. For instance, Aurora uploads videos of their truck navigating
                aggressive swerves and tire blowouts on their website, while Waymo posts videos of their vehicle
                navigating road occlusions and sudden pedestrian appearances on their Youtube channel.

            <p> AV companies show the safety of their vehicles by highlighting safety innovation features. Zoox
                emphasizes their bidirectional
                vehicle design, a four wheel independent steering, braking system, seatbelt crash avoidance system, and
                independent redundant backup
                systems on their website . Zoox also includes a Missions Operations Team that monitors the health of the

            <h2 class="btd">Beyond the Data</h2>

            <p>One of the most effective methods in building the credibility of autonomous vehicles is community
                outreach.
                As someone who has been in an AV before, describing my positive experience to my family and friends
                immediately turns
                their safety concerns into enthusiasm for the future of autonomous technology. <br><br>

                    First responder training workshops are held to train workers to identify emergency safety functions
                    in the vehicle.
                    Zoox also includes testimonial messages from members of the police and fire departments from its

                    nationwide,
                    such as Lighthouse for the Blind SF and The Epilepsy Foundation to spread awareness on the
                    accessibility and safety of their vehicles for the disabled
                    (Waymo, 2025). To spark interest in AV in the broader population, Waymo also sponsors content
                    creators to document their experience of riding in a Waymo vehicle
                    for the first time.
