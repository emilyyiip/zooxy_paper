            <h1>How does the autonomous vehicle industry show that their vehicles are safe?</h1>

            <p class="name"> By Emily Yip</p>

            <p>
                Autonomous vehicles (AV) are transforming modern transportation. As AV companies expand into various
                metropolitan cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, concerns regarding
                passenger safety continue to shape public perception. Understanding how AV companies demonstrate
                that their vehicles are safe is critical to gaining public trust and successful widespread deployment.
                This document provides an overview of the methods and data that AV companies employ to communicate the
                safety of their vehicles.
            </p>

            <p> AV companies adhere to the following standards for the development of their vehicles:</p>

                        Outlines how AV developers should design, test, and validate their vehicles.

            <p>These standards establish a foundation of baseline safety that guides the production and functionality of
                AVs. They ensure that the vehicles have consistent
                system performance, which provides transparency and builds public confidence. </p>

            <h2>Safety Metric Data</h2>

            <p> AV companies evaluate their vehicles on the following metrics to quantify their performance compared to
                human crash benchmarks. The human crash benchmarks are <a href="https://cdan.dot.gov">public data</a>
                published by the NHTSA.</p>

            <p> By using these data metrics, prospective riders can understand how often crashes occur in AVs and
                their severity. This quantification allows them to determine whether riding in an AV is
                actually safer than a human driver and where it could improve in performance, providing further
                transparency.</p>

        <section id="test-sim">

            <h2 class="testsim">Test and Simulation Data</h2>

            <p>AV companies rigorously test the perception and localization ability of their vehicles through
                simulations that recreate edge cases
                to show that they can navigate high-risk scenarios.
                Conducting and evaluating vehicle performance in these simulations require sensor data, labelled
                objects, and highly detailed mapping. </p>

            <div class="sim-panel">

                <div class="panel">

                    <div class="panel-header">

                        <img src=assets/sensor.png class="panel-icon">

                        <h3> Sensors</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p> AV companies use light and detection ranging data (LiDAR) to measure depth from a vehicle to
                        objects, enabling the creation of a detailed 3D mapping of its surroundings.<br><br>

                        Vehicles also use radars for real-time speed and distance measurements. Radars excel in harsher
                        weather and lighting conditions. <br><br>

                        LiDAR and radars are combined to detect incoming vehicles and their speeds, park, perform lane
                        changes, and other vehicle functions.

                        <h3> Objects</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p>Extensively labelled object datasets are needed to simulate realistic scenarios and train
                        computer vision models. Companies use
                        various 3D and 2D semantic segmentations, bounding box labels on camera and LiDAR data, and key
                        point labels on object frames. They include objects ranging from pedestrians and bicyclists to
                        road
                        signs and vegetation, ensuring their models are generalizable to all roads. </p>

                        <h3> Mapping</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p> Detailed mapping of roads in operating cities is critical to AV testing. AV companies create
                        3D maps of road segments, which includes boundaries, road signs, bumps, and entrances to
                        driveways. These maps also store semantic information such as which lanes pedestrians will
                        typically cross in and traffic flows on busier intersections, allowing vehicles to learn more
                        complex patterns in the data.</p>

            <p> To communicate these results, AV companies share footage of their vehicles
                navigating challenging traffic scenarios. Aurora uploads <a href="https://aurora.tech/safety">videos</a>
                of their truck navigating
                aggressive swerves and tire blowouts on their website, while Waymo posts <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubWIuuz-e4">videos</a> of their vehicle
                navigating road occlusions and sudden pedestrian appearances on their Youtube channel.

            <h2 class="btd">Beyond the Data</h2>

            <p>One of the most effective methods in building the credibility of AVs is community
                outreach.
                As someone who has been in an autonomous vehicle before, describing my positive experience to my family
                and friends
                usually turns
                their safety concerns into enthusiasm for the future of autonomous technology. <br><br>

            <div class="bar">

                <p><strong>Zoox</strong><br>
                    Workshops are held to educate first responders in identifying emergency safety functions
                    in the vehicle. Zoox also published an emergency response guide and rescue sheet, which details how
                    to properly interact with the vehicle in the event of an emergency.
                    To strengthen credibility, Zoox includes testimonial messages from members of the police and fire
                    departments in its
                    operating cities. <br><br>

                    <strong>Waymo</strong><br>
                    The Community Partners division collaborates with organizations both local to San Francisco and
                    nationwide,
                    such as Lighthouse for the Blind SF and The Epilepsy Foundation to spread awareness on the
                    accessibility and safety of their vehicles for the disabled. To spark interest in AV
                    in the broader population, Waymo also sponsors content
                    creators to document their experience of riding in a Waymo vehicle

            <h2 class="ref">Conclusion</h2>
            <p> AV companies use various data metrics to communicate the safety of their vehicles, such as crash data
                and high-risk simulation testing results, as well as community outreach. As these companies continue to
                expand into increasingly complex environments,
                the importance of data-driven storytelling and transparency will only grow. Demonstrating accountability
                for safety is critical to gaining public trust in autonomous technology and ultimately ensuring its
                long term success.
